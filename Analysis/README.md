# Intro
All our analysis can be found in jupyter notebook format. Results and random seeds used are stored in `Results/` and `seeds`..

# Requirements
It will be easier to reproduce the analysis by using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Please follow its [instructions](https://jupyter.org/install.html) to install. Also, you'll need two more python packages, `pandas` and `seaborn`. To install :
```
sudo pip3 install pandas seaborn
```
